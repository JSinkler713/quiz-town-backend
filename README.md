# Quiz-Town-Backend

## Stack
Using node.js express, mongoose and mongodb.

## To get Started
Needs a frontend, mine is in React. Clone, and `npm i` to install required packages. Data is fetched from 'localhost:4000/api/v1', so a GET request to 'localhost:4000/api/v1/quiz/<quizName>' will get you JSON data with that specific quizName.
